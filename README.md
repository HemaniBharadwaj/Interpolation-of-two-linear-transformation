# Interpolation-of-two-linear-transformation
Interpolating Linear Transformations: Let us say two linear transformations are given, A, B ∈ R3×4 . These linear transformations can be seen as functions between R3 to R3 . Let P ⊂ R3 represent a digital object. If P(0) = A · P and P(1) = B · P represent the position and pose of object P at time t = 0 and time t = 1 respectively, how can one figure out the intermediate object positions and pose P(t), t ∈ (0, 1)
